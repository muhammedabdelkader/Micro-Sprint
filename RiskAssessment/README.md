Creating a Go module for information security risk assessment would involve
several steps, including identifying the specific risks and vulnerabilities to
be assessed, determining the appropriate methods and metrics for assessing those
risks, and then implementing those methods and metrics in Go code. Here's an
example of how one might structure a Go module for performing a simple
information security risk assessment:

Define structs for representing the assets, threats, and vulnerabilities to be
assessed.
Copy code
type Asset struct {
    Name        string
        Description string
            Value       int
            
}

type Threat struct {
    Name        string
        Description string
            Probability float64
                Impact      int
                
}

type Vulnerability struct {
    Name        string
        Description string
            CVSS        float64
            
}
Create a function that calculates the risk score for a given asset, threat, and
vulnerability.
Copy code
func CalculateRiskScore(asset Asset, threat Threat, vulnerability Vulnerability)
    float64 {
        return vulnerability.CVSS * threat.Probability * float64(asset.Value) *
        float64(threat.Impact)
        
    }
    Create a function that assesses the risk score for a given asset and threat
    and returns the vulnerability that has the greatest risk score.
    Copy code
    func AssessRisk(asset Asset, threat Threat, vulnerabilities []Vulnerability)
    Vulnerability {
        var highestRiskScore float64
            var highestRiskVulnerability Vulnerability
            for _, vuln := range vulnerabilities {
                    riskScore := CalculateRiskScore(asset, threat, vuln)
                                   if riskScore > highestRiskScore {
                                               highestRiskScore = riskScore
                                                           highestRiskVulnerability
                                                           = vuln
                                                                   
                                   }
                                       
            }
                return highestRiskVulnerability
                
    }
