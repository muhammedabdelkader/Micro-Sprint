rules:
##
# This rule looks for the copy function and checks 
# if it's called on a variable that has a len or cap 
# field, which are commonly used to define the size 
# of a buffer in Go. If the rule finds such a call, 
# it raises an alert with the message "Possible buffer overflow detected".

        - any:

##
# This rule looks for specific function calls such as 
# memcpy, make, new and checks if they are used to create a buffer with a fixed size, 
# if so it raises an alert with the message "Possible buffer overflow detected".
