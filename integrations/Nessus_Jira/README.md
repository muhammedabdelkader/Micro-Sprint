To integrate Nessus and Jira in Go, you can use the Nessus API to retrieve
vulnerability information and then use the Jira API to create or update issues
in Jira.

Here is an example of how to do this:

1. First, import the necessary libraries for interacting with the Nessus and Jira
APIs:
```
import (
    "github.com/tenable/nessus-go/nessus"
        "github.com/andygrunwald/go-jira"
        
       )

```
2. Next, create a client for the Nessus API and authenticate with your Nessus
instance:
```
client, _ := nessus.NewClient("https://nessus.example.com", "username",
"password")

```
3. Use the Nessus client to retrieve the vulnerability information you need. For
   example, to get a list of all vulnerabilities:
```
vulnerabilities, _ := client.Vulnerabilities.List()
```
4. Next, create a client for the Jira API and authenticate with your Jira
   instance:

   ```
jiraClient, _ := jira.NewClient(nil, "https://jira.example.com")
jiraClient.Authentication.SetBasicAuth("username", "password")

   ```
5. Use the Jira client to create or update issues in Jira for each
   vulnerability. For example, to create a new issue:
   ```
   issue := &jira.Issue{
Fields: &jira.IssueFields{
        Summary:     "Vulnerability found: " + vulnerability.Name,
                Description: "A vulnerability of " + vulnerability.Severity + "
                severity has been found on host " + vulnerability.Hostname +
                ".",
                Project: &jira.Project{
                            Key: "PROJECT_KEY",
                                    
                },
Issuetype: &jira.IssueType{
            Name: "Bug",
                    
           },
               
        },
        
   }
   newIssue, _, _ := jiraClient.Issue.Create(issue)

   ```
You may also have to map the Nessus severity to Jira issue priority and other
fields. And you may also have to handle the pagination and rate limit of the API
calls.
